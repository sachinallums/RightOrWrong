# scsnl-rightorwrong

A project created for the Stanford Cognitive Systems and Neuroscience Laboratory during the summer of 2023.

## About

This project was initially created in Flutter Flow to quickly create UI/UX designs and then converted into Flutter and integrated with Firebase to allow for more complex data collection for an academic study. Right of Wrong is one game of a suite of 7 different games all aimed at helping children with mathematical dyscalculia subitize different quantities of numbers and improve their number sense. This specific game, Right or Wrong, presents children with anywhere from 3 to 5 different numbers. If these numbers are all increasing or decreasing in quantity (i.e. 1, 5, 7), the player will select the answer "It's Right!" Otherwise, if the sequence of numbers has a mixed order (i.e. 27, 19, 6, 33), the player will need to select the answer "It's Wrong!" The size of the numbers, as well as the number of numbers presented, and whether they are in a symbolic or non-symbolic form, get increasingly difficult as the player progresses through the game.
